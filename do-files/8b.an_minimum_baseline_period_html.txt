Description of analyses used to define the minimum baseline
period
===============================================================

This HTML file includes the information needed to understand how the
minimum baseline period was derived.

## BACKGROUND
~~~~

When using routinely collected health data, we start follow-up after a minimum
baseline period to avoid defining prevalent cases entered into the patient record 
after registration in the practice as incident cases. Traditionally, researchers
have used a 12 month period. Specifying a shorter period might be equally valid, 
and increase follow-up time in the study and the number of cases included.

Leahy at al published an abstract recommending methods to estimate an appropriate
baseline period, including inspecting a plot of incidence over time since
registration.

## METHODS
~~~~

We estimated incidence (95%) confidence rates stratified by time since diagnoses 
using Stata's strate command and saved our estimates in the following analysis
data file. One month time since diagnosis categories were used for the first
5 months, and 3 month categories from 6 months to 2 years. Incidence rates
were further stratified by calendar year groups, CPRD database and age groups.

We plotted incidence rates over time using the mid-point of each time since
diagnosis category.
