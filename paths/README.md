# `paths/`

* All file paths to locations outside of this repository go here
* Add paths to a file called `paths.do` which is included in `.gitignore` (it will not be uploaded)
* Use `run "paths/paths.do"` to access the file paths
* The `paths.do` file may look like this:
> global path_secure_drive_1 "DRIVE:/first/path/to/your/data"
>
> global path_secure_drive_2  "DRIVE:/second/path/to/your/data"
> 
> global path_secure_drive_3  "DRIVE:/third/path/to/your/data"
