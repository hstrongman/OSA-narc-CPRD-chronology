Description of narcolepsy code lists
===============================================================

~~~~
This HTML file includes information that is needed to use the 
narcolepsy code lists to define narcolepsy and to cite the authors.
Researchers, refer to codelist_narcolepsy.do for instructions
about modifying this file.

## HDR UK phenotype definition file
~~~~
Temporary comment: I have used the HDR phenotype structure as an example. We need
to decide whether to upload code lists to HDR UK, data compass or
another repository.

## DEFINITION
All codes for narcolepsy categorised as follows using the category variable:

Categories (category variable):
1 "Narcolepsy"
4 "Cataplexy only"

Codes for narcolepsy are not separated by type because most codes are 
non-specific. When the term includes both narcolepsy and cataplexy, 
the associated codes are chapter headings with subcodes that encompass
both types of narcolepsy.

Here are recommendations to use these categories to identify a narcolepsy
diagnosis. 

(1) First ever record of narcolepsy (codes 1). 
(2) Plan to exclude people with cataplexy recorded before this date. 
Check that the number of people excluded is very small and that their are very
few people with cataplexy without narcolepsy as this is extremely rare.

~~~~
## STUDIES AND PROTOCOLS
~~~~
I will add a link to my fellowship protocol when I've decided which site to
upload it to.

Description of how the narcolepsy code lists were created
===============================================================

~~~~
This HTML file includes the information needed for clinicians
and researchers to understand how the code lists are derived.
Researchers can update the code lists following the instructions in
codelist_narcolepsy.do

~~~~
## BASIC SEARCH
~~~~


The following search terms are used to generate the initial code lists. Each 
term is searched for individually and included or excluded if 
it appears in any position in the text. The terms cover all synonyms
for narcolepsy. Chapter searches only apply to code lists that include
Read codes; these include CPRD Aurum code lists as a large proportion of Snomed
codes are matched to Read codes.

Inclusion terms: narcolep cataplexy

Inclusion chapters: F27

Exclusion terms: 

Exclusion chapters: 




~~~~
## CODE LIST SPECIFIC SEARCH CRITERIA
~~~~

There are no code list specific algorithms for narcolepsy.

~~~~
## CHECK EXCLUDED CODES
~~~~

The following list includes all codes that have been excluded from the code
list. This should be checked carefully.




~~~~
## CREATE CATEGORIES
~~~~


The categories are defined using the following criteria. These are described so
that the search can be replicated using different software.

1: Narcolepsy
This category includes terms including the strings "narcolep". In the CPRD GOLD
dictionary, there are Read codes in chapter F27 with no associated observations
or terms. I have kept them in the codelist and categorised them here for now. 
I will double check this when I have extracted the data.


2: Cataplexy only
This category includes terms including the strings "cataplexy" and not "narcolep"

~~~~
## CHECK INCLUDED CODES AND CATEGORISATION
~~~~


~~~~
## Codes by categorylab
~~~~

The following table includes all included terms and the assigned category.
It is provided so that clinicians and researchers can check whether all codes 
are relevant and categorised correctly.

## Number of observations per category
~~~~

The following table describes the number of observations in the CPRD database
for each category. This information can be used to sense check the proposed
phenotype definitions in codelist_narcolepsy_description.html.

Observations counts will be O for HES APC data because there is no equivalent
field in the dictionary.

     |       category   observ~s |

There are no code lists to compare at this stage.
