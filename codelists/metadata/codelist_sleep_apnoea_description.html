<pre><code>## DEFINITION
Codes for sleep apnoea are categorised as follows using the category variable:

Categories (category variable):
1 &quot;Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)&quot;
2 &quot;Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS)&quot;
3 &quot;Sleep apnoea NOS&quot;
4 &quot;Sleep apnoea syndrome NOS&quot;
5 &quot;Central sleep apnoea only&quot;
6 &quot;Primary sleep apnoea only&quot; 

Here are recommendations to use these categories to identify an Obstructive
Sleep Apnoea diagnosis and for censoring follow-up when other types of sleep 
apnoea are diagnosed. 

(1) First ever record of OSA (codes 1 to 4). 
OSA/OSAS are the most commonly diagnosed form of sleep apnoea and GPs often use 
nonspecific codes. Specialists do differentiate between OSA
and OSAS but it will not be possible to do this using primary care data. 
Mixed sleep apnoea codes are included in codes 1 to 4 because OSA is likely to
be the dominant or at least co-dominant condition. 
(2) Exclude if prior record of central sleep apnoea or primary sleep apnoea
(codes 5 &amp; 6). These are distinct from OSA with different co-morbidities and 
health implications.
(3) Censor follow up if central sleep apnoea or primary sleep apnoea are recorded
after diagnosis with OSA.
