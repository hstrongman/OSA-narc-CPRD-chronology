## HDR UK phenotype definition file

Temporary comment: I have used the HDR phenotype structure as an example. We need
to decide whether to upload code lists to HDR UK, data compass or
another repository.

## DEFINITION
All codes for narcolepsy categorised as follows using the category variable:

Categories (category variable):
1 "Narcolepsy"
4 "Cataplexy only"

Codes for narcolepsy are not separated by type because most codes are 
non-specific. When the term includes both narcolepsy and cataplexy, 
the associated codes are chapter headings with subcodes that encompass
both types of narcolepsy.

Here are recommendations to use these categories to identify a narcolepsy
diagnosis. 

(1) First ever record of narcolepsy (codes 1). 
(2) Plan to exclude people with cataplexy recorded before this date. 
Check that the number of people excluded is very small and that their are very
few people with cataplexy without narcolepsy as this is extremely rare.

I will add a link to my fellowship protocol when I've decided which site to
upload it to.
