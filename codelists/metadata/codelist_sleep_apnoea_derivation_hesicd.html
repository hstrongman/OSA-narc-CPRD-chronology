<h1><a href="#description-of-how-the-sleep-apnoea-code-lists-were-created" id="description-of-how-the-sleep-apnoea-code-lists-were-created">Description of how the sleep apnoea code lists were created</a></h1>
<pre><code>This HTML file includes the information needed for clinicians
and researchers to understand how the code lists are derived.
Researchers can update the code lists following the instructions in
codelist_sleep_apnoea.do.

</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#basic-search" id="basic-search">BASIC SEARCH</a></h2>
<pre><code>

The following search terms are used to generate the initial code lists. Each 
term is searched for individually and included or excluded if 
it appears in any position in the text. The terms should cover all synonyms
for sleep apnoea. Chapter searches only apply to code lists that include
Read codes; these include CPRD Aurum code lists as a large proportion of Snomed
codes are matched to Read.

Inclusion terms: apnoea apnea OSA

Inclusion chapters: H5B R005 Fy03


Exclusion chapters: 


Note: Care pathway terms are excluded in the new code list because they are 
rarely used and mostly indicate testing for sleep apnoea


</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#code-list-specific-search-algorithm" id="code-list-specific-search-algorithm">CODE LIST SPECIFIC SEARCH ALGORITHM</a></h2>
<pre><code>
Terms without both &quot;sleep&quot; and either &quot;apnoea&quot; or &quot;apnea&quot; are
excluded.

<h2><a href="#check-excluded-codes" id="check-excluded-codes">CHECK EXCLUDED CODES</a></h2>
<pre><code>
The following list includes all codes that have been excluded from the code
list. This should be checked carefully.

<h2><a href="#create-categories" id="create-categories">CREATE CATEGORIES</a></h2>
<pre><code>

The categories are defined using the following criteria. They are not in
numeric order because the categories that are defined later use information
used to create earlier categories. These are provided so that the search can
be replicated using different software.

1: Obstructive Sleep Apnoea
This category includes terms including the strings &quot;obstructive&quot; or &quot;mixed&quot; but not &quot;syndrome&quot;


2: Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome
This category includes terms including &quot;obstructive&quot; or &quot;mixed&quot; and &quot;syndrome&quot;


5. Central sleep apnoea
This category includes terms including the string &quot;central&quot;


6. Primary sleep apnoea
This category includes terms including the string &quot;primary&quot;


4. Sleep apnoea syndrome NOS
This category includes terms that have not been classified and include the string &quot;syndrome&quot;


3. sleep apnoea NOS
This category includes terms that have not been classified

It is provided so that researchers and clinicians can check whether all codes
are relevant and categorised correctly.

<pre><code>
The following table described the number of observations in the CPRD database
for each category. This information can be used to sense check the proposed
phenotype definitions in codelist_sleep_apnoea_description.html.

Observations counts will be O for HES APC data because there is no equivalent
field in the dictionary.
