# COVER SHEET


## 0. Metadata

### a. Codelist name 

Staff group (staffgroup)

and Helen Strongman (LSHTM)

### c. Date finalised: 11/04/2024

### d. Target data source(s)

- Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD (up to March 2023)

## 1. Define a clinical concept

### a. Concept

This do file classifies data from the staff file in CPRD GOLD and Aurum to:

6	Locum (locum/deputising service NOS)

	
### b. Timeframe: 
	
N/A
	
### c. Accuracy:

Classification is generally clear with the exception of "Locum NOS" codes which could
refer to medical or nursing staff.

### d. Setting: 

Primary care. 

## 2. Search existing codelists
	
### a. Sources searched

emailed colleagues at the Health Foundation and LSHTM

### b. Existing codelists found

(improvement analytics unit)
	
## 3. Evaluate existing code lists

### b. Verified by researcher.

Categorisation seems clear and accurate.

## 4. Existing code lists used

## 5. Prepare

### a. Synonyms

N/A

## b. Exceptions

the same logic to each code.

### b. Search terms

N/A

### c. Hierachy used to extend the search

The codelist will be published on LSHTM data compass and in the Github
repository for this project, prior to publication of the resulting paper.
(and in the LSHTM code list Github repository if we can get funding/time to build this)
