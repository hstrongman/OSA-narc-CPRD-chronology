Codelist name: Ethnicity 

Data source(s):
    - Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD (up to March 2023)
    - Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum (up to March 2023)
	- Note CPRD provide categorised ethnicity data for HES

Terminology(s)
    - Read Version 2 (GOLD)
    - SNOMED-CT (and EMIS codes) (Aurum)
  
Clinical concept:
	Ethnicity. The search identifies all codes indicating an individual's
	ethnicity as conceptualised and defined by the Office of National Statistics.
	
	Codes with the following concepts in the read term are included:
	- codes that specify they refer to ethnicity/ethnic groups or categories
	-mixed and non-mixed ethnicity codes
	- codes including terms such as white, black, caucasian, aisian
	- codes in ethnicity Read chapters that are synonomous with, or represent
	countries with a largely homogonous ethnic population (e.g. Japanese, Indian)
	
	Codes that describe other countries or regions, nationalities or religions 
	are not included (e.g. England, Europe, British, Christian).
	
	The conceptualisation of ethnicity evolves over time and this will need to
	be reevaluated periodically.
