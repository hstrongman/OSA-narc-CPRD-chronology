# COVER SHEET


## 0. Metadata

### a. Codelist name 

dexamfetamine

### b. Author(s)

Helen Strongman

### c. Date finalised: 02 February 2024

### d. Target data source(s)

- Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD (up to March 2023)
- Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum (up to March 2023)

### e. Terminology(s)
CPRD Aurum Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (dm+d) mapped to

CPRD GOLD gemscriptcode mapped to CPRD prodcode
  
## 1. Define a clinical concept

### a. Concept

dexamfetamine prescriptions
	
### b. Timeframe: 
	
no restrictions
	
### c. Accuracy:

There is no ambiguity in coding for this code list.

### d. Setting: 

Prescriptions written in primary care

## 2. Search existing codelists
	
### a. Sources searched

used google to search for "cprd dexamphetamine" and 
"cprd dexamfetamine" 

### b. Existing codelists found

https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/28/codelist/res28-adhd-prodcodes/
	
## 3. Evaluate existing code lists

### a. Verified by others.

no information

### b. Verified by researcher.

codes not split out by drug substance

## 4. Existing code lists used

### a. as above

N/A


## 5. Prepare

### a. Synonyms

dexamphetamine sulphate, dexamfetamine sulfate, amfexa, dexedrine =
modified release (identified by searching BNF chapter "Amfetamines" including
names in the "medicinal forms" section)

## b. Exceptions

lisdexamfetamine = prodrug of dexamefetamine not licensed for narcolepsy

## 6. Create

### a. Method used

Used lower case search terms in a script to search drug substance
and product name fields - terms recorded anywhere in string. 
Checked for additional product names to search for by listing product names
where dexamfetamine was the drug substance

### b. Search terms

inclusion (dexam, amfexa, dexedrine)
exclusion (lisdex adderall durophet)

### c. Hierachy used to extend the search

None

### d. Decisions made while iterating

added adderall and durophet

### e. Categories

N/A

## 7. Review

### a. Reviewers

need to find a clinician

### b. Scope of review

Both the draft codelist and search and exclusion terms
were reviewed.

### c. Evidence of review

The process is documented in this HTML file.

## 8. Publish

### a. Codelist published

The codelist will be published on LSHTM data compass and in the Github
repository for this project, prior to publication of the resulting paper.
(and in the LSHTM code list Github repository if we can get funding/time to build this)

	
Files include:
- codelist_dexamfetamine_aurum.txt
- codelist_dexamfetamine_aurum.dta

### b. Resources published

Do files and HMTL documents describing codelist and search strategy
