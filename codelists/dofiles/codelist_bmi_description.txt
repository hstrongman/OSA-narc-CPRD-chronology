Codelist name: Body Mass Index 

Data source(s):
    - Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD (up to March 2023)
	(Use entity types for CPRD GOLD)

Terminology(s)
    - SNOMED-CT (and EMIS codes) (Aurum)
  
Clinical concept:
	Current Body Mass Index measurement.
	Aims to identify all clinical codes that represent a current height, 
	weight or BMI measurement in CPRD Aurum data. 
	Excludes BMI measurement during pregnancy.
	
	The search strategy prioritises sensitivity over specificity unless codes
	signal that an incorrect value might be associated with it (e.g. BMI centile
	, ideal weight). Codes that are rarely associated with a value are not a
	problem as these are excluded when processing the data.
	
	Codes are categorised using separate height, weight and BMI variables

Bhaskaran K, Forbes HJ, Douglas I, et alRepresentativeness and optimal use of
body mass index (BMI) in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)
BMJ Open 2013;3:e003389. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003389

The above study compared observed BMI distributions in CPRD GOLD to HSE data.
It directly using numerical data in the Additional file (identified
using enttypes). This followed an analysis showing that additional Read code
searches added minimial information.
