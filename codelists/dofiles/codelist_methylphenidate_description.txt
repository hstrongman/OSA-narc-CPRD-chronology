## 1. Define a clinical concept

### a. Concept

methylphenidate prescriptions
	
### b. Timeframe: 
	
no restrictions
	
### c. Accuracy:

There is no ambiguity in coding for this code list.

### d. Setting: 

Prescriptions written in primary care

## 2. Search existing codelists
	
### a. Sources searched

used google to search for "cprd methylphenidate"

### b. Existing codelists found

https://clinicalcodes.rss.mhs.man.ac.uk/medcodes/article/28/codelist/res28-adhd-prodcodes/
	
## 3. Evaluate existing code lists

### a. Verified by others.

no information

### b. Verified by researcher.

codes not split out by drug substance

## 4. Existing code lists used

### a. as above

N/A


## 5. Prepare

### a. Synonyms

methylphenidate concerta delmosart equasym medikinet xaggitin tranquilyn ritalin
affenid matoride xenidate equasym meflynate metyrol
(identified by searching BNF entry for methylphenidate including
names in the "medicinal forms" section)

## b. Exceptions
none

## 6. Create

### a. Method used

Used lower case search terms in a script to search drug substance, product name
and termfromemis fields - terms recorded anywhere in string. 
Checked for additional product names to search for by listing product names
where methylphenidate was the drug substance

### b. Search terms

inclusion (methylphenidate concerta delmosart equasym medikinet 
xaggitin tranquilyn ritalin affenid matoride xenidate equasym meflynate metyrol)

### c. Hierachy used to extend the search

None

### d. Decisions made while iterating

None

### e. Categories

N/A

## 7. Review

### a. Reviewers

Dr Sofia Eriksson (Neurologist and sleep specialist, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and UCL)

### b. Scope of review

Both the draft codelist and search and exclusion terms
were reviewed.

### c. Evidence of review

The process is documented in this HTML file.

## 8. Publish

### a. Codelist published

The codelist will be published on LSHTM data compass and in the Github
repository for this project, prior to publication of the resulting paper.
(and in the LSHTM code list Github repository if we can get funding/time to build this)

	
Files include:
- codelist_methylphenidate_aurum.txt
- codelist_methylphenidate_aurum.dta

### b. Resources published

Do files and HMTL documents describing codelist and search strategy
