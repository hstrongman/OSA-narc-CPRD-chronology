### d. Target data source(s)
Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD (up to March 2023)
Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum (up to March 2023)

SNOMED-CT (and EMIS codes) (Aurum)


## 1. Define a clinical concept

### a. Concept
Ethnicity. The search identifies all codes indicating an individual's
	ethnicity as conceptualised and defined by the Office of National Statistics.

Codes with the following concepts in the read term are included:
	- codes that specify they refer to ethnicity/ethnic groups or categories
	-mixed and non-mixed ethnicity codes
	- codes including terms such as white, black, caucasian, aisian
	- codes in ethnicity Read chapters that are synonomous with, or represent
	countries with a largely homogonous ethnic population (e.g. Japanese, Indian)
	
Codes that describe other countries or regions, nationalities or religions 
are not included (e.g. England, Europe, British, Christian).
	
The conceptualisation of ethnicity evolves over time and this will need to
be reevaluated periodically.
	

### b. Timeframe: 
	
??
	
### c. Accuracy:
??


### d. Setting: 
The Office of National Statistics (ONS) has highlighted that there is no true consensus 
on what defines an ethnic group, as identification to these is self-defined and subjectively 
meaningful to the individual.

Ethnicity is often associated with race and relates to the population group a person 
belongs to, identifies with or is identified by, considering cultural factors including 
language, diet, religion, ancestry and physical features. However, it is generally 
accepted that ethnicity includes all of these aspects, and others, in combination. 



## 2. Search existing codelists
	
### a. Sources searched
??

### b. Existing codelists found
??


## 3. Evaluate existing code lists

### a. Verified by others.
??


### b. Verified by researcher.
??


## 4. Existing code lists used
CPRD have validated an ethnicity code list and algorithm.


# 5. Prepare

### a. Synonyms
Ethnicity is not a well-defined concept because the conceptualisation of ethnicity evolves over time 
and this will need to be reevaluated periodically.
*Note CPRD have validated an ethnicity code list and algorithm.


## b. Exceptions
??
The search has not excluded any terms that were included in the previous codelist.



## 6. Create

### a. Method used

The following search Read chapters and term strings are applied to all codes in the
current dictionary. Each chapter or term string is searched for individually
and flagged (strings may appear in any position in the text. 
The terms should cover all synonyms for ethnicity (see strategy in code list
description). Chapter searches only apply to code lists that include
Read codes; these include CPRD Aurum code lists as a large proportion of Snomed
codes are matched to Read.


A Stata script (do file) was used to create the codelist. This exports a dyndoc
file that describes the process and decisions made (See derivation HTML file)

Files created:
	- codelist_ethnicity_gold.dta
	- codelist_ethnicity_aurum.dta
	- codelist_ethnicity_gold.txt
	- codelist_ethnicity_aurum.txt

*Check codes that are not in Read Chapters identifying ONS ethnicity groups and
 HAVE been excluded.



### b. Search terms
Inclusion terms: ??

Exclusion terms: Codes that describe other countries or regions, nationalities 
or religions are not included (e.g. England, Europe, British, Christian).
Religion codes from census categories were removed in this version.
Refusal to provide information about ethnic group removed in this version.


### c. Hierarchy used to extend the search
??
The search has not excluded any terms that were included in the previous codelist.

### d. Decisions made while iterating
Codes that were categorised as Black Other in the previous code list were
recategorised as Black African in the new code list.


### e. Categories
Ethnicity codes are grouped as follows using the eth5 and eth16 variables:

eth5:
0 0. White
1 1. South Asian
2 2. Black
3 3. Other
4 4. Mixed
5 5. Not Stated
		   
eth16:
1 1. British
2 2. Irish
3 3. Other White
4 4. White and Black Caribbean
5 5. White and Black African
6 6. White and Asian
7 7. Other Mixed
8 8. Indian
9 9. Pakistani
10 10. Bangladeshi
11 11. Other Asian
12 12. Caribbean
13 13. African
14 14. Other Black
15 15. Chinese
16 16. Other ethnic group
17 17. Not Stated
88 88. Unknown
