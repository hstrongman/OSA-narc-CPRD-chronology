# COVER SHEET


## 0. Metadata

### a. Codelist name: 

Narcolepsy

### b. Author(s): 

Helen Strongman (created original codes list and strategy)

### c. Date finalised:

2022-08-05

### d. Target data source(s)
Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD (up to March 2023)
Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum (up to March 2023)
linked Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care Data (HES APC)

### e. Terminology(s)
SNOMED-CT (and EMIS codes) (Aurum)
Read Version 2 (GOLD)
ICD-10 (HES APC)
  
## 1. Define a clinical concept

### a. Concept

Narcolepsy diagnoses recorded in primary care or hospital admissions data
	
### b. Timeframe: 
	
Classify all codes recorded at any time
	
### c. Accuracy:

The accuracy of the codelists were assessed in a validation study.

XX comment on the PPV

Specificity is therefore ...

We have not assessed the sensitivity of the code list. 

### d. Setting: 

Narcolepsy is diagnosed by sleep specialists following an overnight hospital
visit. Sleep specialists inform the general practice of the diagnosis. GP
pratice staff may add a coded record of the diagnosis at this time to support
ongoing care; our validation study demonstrates that narcolepsy codes may also
be recorded when the GP suspects a narcolepsy diagnosis. 

Narcolepsy may be recorded in hospital episode statistics when a
patient is admitted to hospital for a condition related to narcolepsy or if
narcolepsy affected their care.
	
## 2. Search existing codelists
	
### a. Sources searched

- googled "narcolepsy codelist cprd"

### b. Existing codelists found

- None
	
## 3. Evaluate existing code lists

### a. Verified by others.

N/A

### b. Verified by researcher.

N/A


## 4. Existing code lists used

N/A


## 5. Prepare

### a. Synonyms

Narcolepsy is a well defined condition with no synonyms. People with narcolepsy
are sometimes described as narcoleptic and cataplexy is a distinctive symptom
of the condition.

## b. Exceptions

All codes were classified as indicative of "Narcolepsy" or "Cataplexy only"

## 6. Create

### a. Method used

A Stata script (do file) was used to create the codelist. This exports a dyndoc
file that describes the process and decisions made (See derivation HTML file)

### b. Search terms

Inclusion terms: "narcolep" or "cataplexy" at any position in the descriptive code associated
with each term.

Exclusion terms: none

### c. Hierarchy used to extend the search

We searched Read chapter F27 (Cataplexy and narcolepsy) for the GOLD and Aurum
code lists. Read codes are mapped to some of the Snomed codes in the Aurum data
dictionary.

### d. Decisions made while iterating

Chapter F27 added to the search

### e. Categories

All codes for narcolepsy/cataplexy were categorised as follows using the 
category variable:

Categories (category variable):
1 "Narcolepsy"
2 "Cataplexy only"

Codes for narcolepsy are not separated by type because most codes are 
non-specific and chapter headings for "narcolepsy and cataplexy" may be used
as a default by general practice staff.

## 7. Review

### a. Reviewers

Dr Sofia Erikkson (Consultant neurologist and Honorary Associate Professor at 
National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and UCLH and the UCL/Institute 
of Neurology)

Dr Tim Quinnell (Consultant respiratory and sleep disorders physician, Royal
Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust)

### b. Scope of review

The final codelists were checked.

### c. Evidence of review

The process is documented in this HTML file.

## 8. Publish

### a. Codelist published

The codelist will be published on LSHTM data compass and in the Github
repository for this project, prior to publication of the resulting paper.
(and in the LSHTM code list Github repository if we can get funding/time to build this)


### b. Resources published

The full process is described in the derivation HTML document.
Stata scripts (do and dyndoc) will be available in the Github repository.
