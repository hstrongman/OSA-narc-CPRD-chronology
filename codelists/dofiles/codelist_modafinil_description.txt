N/A

### b. Verified by researcher.

N/A

## 4. Existing code lists used

### a. as above

N/A


## 5. Prepare

### a. Synonyms

4040000 - Centrally acting sympathomimetics including product
names in the "medicinal forms" section)

## b. Exceptions

None.

## 6. Create

### a. Method used

Used lower case search terms in a script to search drug substance
product name, and termfromemis fields - terms recorded anywhere in string.

Both the draft codelist and search and exclusion terms
were reviewed.

### c. Evidence of review

The process is documented in this HTML file.

## 8. Publish

### a. Codelist published

The codelist will be published on LSHTM data compass and in the Github
repository for this project, prior to publication of the resulting paper.
(and in the LSHTM code list Github repository if we can get funding/time to build this)

	
Files include:
