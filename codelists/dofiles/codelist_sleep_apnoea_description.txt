Tim Quinnell (Consultant respiratory and sleep disorders physician, Royal
Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust)

### c. Date finalised:
04/08/2022

### d. Target data source(s)
Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD (up to 05_2022)
Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum (up to 05_2022)
Hospital Episode Statistics APC for CPRD GOLD (up to 05_2022)
Hospital Episode Statistics APC for CPRD Aurum (up to 05_2022)

### e. Terminology(s)
Read Version 2 (GOLD)
SNOMED-CT (and EMIS codes) (Aurum)
ICD-10 (HES)


## 1. Define a clinical concept

### a. Concept

Sleep apnoea with categorisation recorded in primary care or hospital espisode data.
Phenotype: disease or syndrome
Group: respiratory


### b. Timeframe: 
???


### c. Accuracy:
The accuracy of the codelists was assessed by casenote review.


### d. Setting: 
Sleep apnoea should be diagnosed by sleep specialists following an overnight test at 
home or at the sleep centre. Sleep specialists inform the general practice of the 
diagnosis. GP pratice staff may add a coded record of the diagnosis at this time to 
support ongoing care. In some cases, GPs diagnose patients with sleep apnoea without 
a specialist input. Our validation study demonstrates that Obstructive Sleep Apnoea.... ADD

Sleep apnoea may be recorded in hospital episode statistics when a
patient is admitted to hospital for a condition related to sleep apnoea or if
sleep apnoea affected their care.


## 2. Search existing codelists
	
### a. Sources searched
Existing codelists:
- googled "sleep apnoea codelist cprd"

 
### b. Existing codelists found
- Res178: Asthma, COPD and sleep apnoea - Code list (University of Manchester)
- HDR UK Phenotype Library: Sleep apnoea PH309 / 618 (Kuan at el. 2021)

 

## 3. Evaluate existing code lists

### a. Verified by others.
???


### b. Verified by researcher.
???


## 4. Existing code lists used
???


## 5. Prepare
NB would need to use HDRUK naming convention to submit
	- codelist_sleep_apnoea_gold.dta
	- codelist_sleep_apnoea_aurum.dta
	- codelist_sleep_apnoea_aurum.dta
	- codelist_sleep_apnoea_gold.txt
	- codelist_sleep_apnoea_aurum.txt
	- codelist_sleep_apnoea_aurum.txt

### a. Synonyms
Sleep apnoea is a well defined-condition. 
The terms should cover all synonyms for sleep apnoea.


## b. Exceptions
???


## 6. Create

### a. Method used

A Stata script (do file) was used to create the codelist. This exports a dyndoc
file that describes the process and decisions made (See derivation HTML file)

### b. Search terms
he following search terms are used to generate the initial code lists. Each 
term is searched for individually and included or excluded if 
it appears in any position in the text. Chapter searches only apply to code lists that include
Read codes; these include CPRD Aurum code lists as a large proportion of Snomed
codes are matched to Read.

Inclusion terms:
1 "Obstructive Sleep Apnoea" ///
This category includes terms including the strings "obstructive" or "mixed" but not "syndrome"

2"Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome" ///
This category includes terms including "obstructive" or "mixed" and "syndrome"

3 "Sleep apnoea NOS" ///
This category includes terms that have not been classified

4 "Sleep apnoea syndrome NOS" ///
This category includes terms that have not been classified and include the string "syndrome"

5 "Central sleep apnoea" ///
This category includes terms including the string "central"

6 "Primary sleep apnoea"
This category includes terms including the string "primary"

Exclusion terms: 
Terms without both "sleep" and either "apnoea" or "apnea" were excluded.
Care pathway codes were excluded.


### c. Hierarchy used to extend the search
ADD


### d. Decisions made while iterating
Separate category for central and primary sleep apnoea was created. 
Care pathway codes were excluded.

### e. Categories
Codes for sleep apnoea are categorised as follows using the category variable:

Categories (category variable):
1 "Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)"
2 "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS)"
3 "Sleep apnoea NOS"
4 "Sleep apnoea syndrome NOS"
5 "Central sleep apnoea only"
6 "Primary sleep apnoea only" 

Here are recommendations to use these categories to identify an Obstructive
Sleep Apnoea diagnosis and for censoring follow-up when other types of sleep 
apnoea are diagnosed. 

(1) First ever record of OSA (codes 1 to 4). 
OSA/OSAS are the most commonly diagnosed form of sleep apnoea and GPs often use 
nonspecific codes. Specialists do differentiate between OSA
and OSAS but it will not be possible to do this using primary care data. 
Mixed sleep apnoea codes are included in codes 1 to 4 because OSA is likely to
be the dominant or at least co-dominant condition. 
(2) Exclude if prior record of central sleep apnoea or primary sleep apnoea
(codes 5 & 6). These are distinct from OSA with different co-morbidities and 
health implications.
(3) Censor follow up if central sleep apnoea or primary sleep apnoea are recorded
after diagnosis with OSA.

sex:
	- Female
	- Male

The categories are defined using the following criteria. They are not in
numeric order because the categories that are defined later use information
used to create earlier categories. These are provided so that the search can
be replicated using different software.



## 7. Review

### a. Reviewers

Dr Sofia Erikkson (Consultant neurologist and Honorary Associate Professor at 
National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and UCLH and the UCL/Institute 
of Neurology)

Dr Tim Quinnell (Consultant respiratory and sleep disorders physician, Royal
Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust)


### b. Scope of review

The final codelists were checked.


### c. Evidence of review

The process is documented in this HTML file.


## 8. Publish

### a. Codelist published
I will add a link to my fellowship protocol when I've decided which site to
upload it to.


### b. Resources published

The full process is described in the derivation HTML document.
Stata scripts (do and dyndoc) will be available in the XX repository.
